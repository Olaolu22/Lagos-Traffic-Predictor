## Overview

As a resident of Lagos, Nigeria‚Äôs bustling economic hub, I‚Äôve often found myself stuck in traffic ‚Äî wasting valuable time, fuel, and energy. Recognizing how congestion affects productivity, safety, and well-being, I decided to apply the AI/ML skills I‚Äôve gained so far to try to predict traffic congestion and help people plan better.

This project is a machine learning-powered web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts traffic congestion levels in the **Ikeja‚ÄìBerger axis of Lagos**, Nigeria.

The web app predicts traffic congestion levels ‚Äî Low, Medium, or High ‚Äî using features like route, time of day, weather, and holiday status.

Though still a prototype, this app has great potential for real-world adoption and scalability.

## What the App Does

- Predicts Lagos traffic congestion as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**
- Accepts user inputs like:
  - Selected Route
  - Weather Condition
  - Time of Day (AM/PM)
  - Day of the Week
  - Weekend & Public Holiday status
- Visually communicates results using colour codes.
- Simple and user-friendly interface


## Dataset(synthetic)
Due to poor data infrastructure in Nigeria, I couldn't find a reliable, open-source dataset for Lagos traffic. I decided to create a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic traffic patterns based on:

- Personal observation of traffic trends in Lagos

- Assumptions around peak hours, holidays, and weather influence

- Though manually generated and not perfect, the dataset captures useful trends for model training.

**Features included:**

- Route
- Weather
- Day
- Hour
- is_rush_hour
- is_weekend
- is_public_holiday
- time_of_day
- Target variable: Categorical ‚Äî Low, Medium, High congestion.


 
## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend & ML**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Design**: Custom PNG image for traffic light indicator

## üìÅ Files

- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit application code
- `lagos_traffic_model(1).pkl`: Trained ML model
- `traffic_light.png`: Visual for output display
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## **Machine Learning Model**

- Model: XGBoost Classifier
- Training size: ~3000 synthetic entries
- Preprocessing: Label encoding & pipeline
- Export: joblib for deployment
- Evaluation: Manually tested using common traffic scenarios

## Goals
- Help Lagos residents reduce time spent in traffic
- Empower people to plan better journeys
- Showcase the potential of Machine Learning and AI in addressing real-world problems
- Lay groundwork for future expansion into real-time prediction with live traffic data

I built everything from scratch (a very tiring process, might I add) ‚Äî including the synthetic dataset, model pipeline, and UI ‚Äî without using AI tools. This project represents my growth, creativity, and ability to apply what I‚Äôve learned.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. I believe this is only the beginning of how we can use technology to solve uniquely Nigerian challenges. Your feedback is welcome!
